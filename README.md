# Threat-Detection-and-Termination-System.
The project aims to develop a cyber security threat detection system that utilizes IDS, NS & ML to detect anomalies, suspicious behaviour or pattern like DDoS attack, intrusion and malware in real-time network traffic. This system will monitor flag potential threats/intrusions and potentially automate backwashes to terminate following threats.
